# Bean-Yield-Prediction-XAI-.
Explainable AI (XAI) for Common Bean Yield Prediction: A Decision Support System using ANN, Random Forest, and SHAP Diagnostics.

1. Project Overview"This repository contains the R implementation of a machine learning-based Decision Support System (DSS) designed to predict seed weight in common bean genotyptes. By integrating black-box models with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we provide both high-accuracy predictions (R^2 = 0.959) and genotype-specific trait diagnostics."2. Key MethodologiesPreprocessing: Outlier detection via Cook's Distance and multicollinearity check via VIF.Algorithms: ANN, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, GBM, and LightGBM.Optimization: 10-fold Cross-Validation and Grid Search.Explainability: Global feature importance and local Waterfall plots for genotype diagnosis.3. HighlightsStatistical Rigor: Bonferroni-adjusted p-values for model comparison.Visual Validation: Taylor Diagrams and Partial Dependence Plots (PDP).Decision Support: A framework for breeders to identify limiting traits in specific genotypes.
