Proposed Methodology WorkflowStep 1: Data Acquisition & Quality Control125 Bean Genotypes / 20 Morphological Traits➔ Outlier Detection (Cook’s Distance)➔ Multicollinearity Analysis (VIF > 10 Removal)Step 2: Data Engineering80:20 Train-Test Split➔ Z-Score Normalization (Based on Training Set Statistics)➔ Feature Selection VerificationStep 3: Predictive Modeling & OptimizationModel Implementation (ANN, RF, SVM, XGBoost, GBM, LightGBM)➔ Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search)➔ 10-Fold Cross-Validation (Overfitting Prevention)Step 4: Statistical ValidationPerformance Metrics (RMSE, $R^2$, MAE)➔ Bonferroni-Adjusted Paired t-test (Model Comparison)➔ Taylor Diagram (Consistency Analysis)Step 5: Explainable AI (XAI) & DiagnosisGlobal Feature Importance (SHAP Summary)➔ Local Genotype Diagnosis (SHAP Waterfall Plots)➔ Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)Final Goal: Decision Support System (DSS)Trait Prioritization for Breeders➔ Genotype-Specific Growth Recommendations➔ Continuous Learning Feedback Loop
